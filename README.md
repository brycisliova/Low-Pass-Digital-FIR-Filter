# Low-Pass Digital FIR Filter using Pt-51

## Introduction
Hey there! Welcome to my repository for Lab Project of EE 337: Microprocessors Laboratory at IIT Bombay. This is where I've documented designing and implementing a low-pass digital FIR filter using Pt-51 microcontroller.

## Implemented
- Designed the filter using Python and obtained the filter coefficients.
- Established communication between PC and Pt-51 using UART protocol.
- Generated a sinusoidal waveform and sent samples serially from PC to Pt-51.
- Implemented the filtering algorithm in C to run on Pt-51.
- Sent the output samples from Pt-51 back to the PC.
- Plotted and analyzed the results using Python libraries.
